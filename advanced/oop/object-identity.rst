Object Identity

Identity
========
.. highlights::
    * ``id()`` will change every time you execute script
    * An integer which is guaranteed to be unique and constant for this object during its lifetime
    * Two objects with non-overlapping lifetimes may have the same id() value.
    * In CPython it's also the memory address of the corresponding C object

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: Note, that ``id()`` will change every time you execute script

    a = 'str'

    id(a)
    # 4499664048

    hex(id(a))
    # '0x10c336cb0'


Hash
====
.. highlights::
    * Return the hash value of the object (if it has one)
    * ``hash() ->  int``
    * They are used to quickly compare dictionary keys during a dictionary lookup
    * ``set()`` elements has to be hashable
    * ``dict()`` keys has to be hashable
    * User-defined classes have ``__eq__()`` and ``__hash__()`` methods by default
    * All objects compare unequal (except with themselves)
    * ``x.__hash__()`` returns an appropriate value such that ``x == y`` implies both that ``x is y`` and ``hash(x) == hash(y)``

.. _String interning:

String interning
================
.. highlights::
    * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_interning
    * Method of storing only one copy of each distinct string value, which must be immutable
    * many high level languages use it
    * string literals and values are internally kept in a hashed list called 'string intern pool' and those which are identical are rendered as references to the same object
    * possible because ``str`` are immutable
    * implementation dependent
    * Jython, IronPython, PyPy and others may intern more aggressively
    * Calling the ``intern()`` function on strings will "force" a string to have the same object identity as any equivalent and previously interned string

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: CPython 3.7.4

    ('a' * 4096) is ('a' * 4096)
    # True

    ('a' * 4097) is ('a' * 4097)
    # False


``is``
======
.. highlights::
    * ``is`` checks for object identity
    * ``is`` tests for identity, not equality
    * Compares ``id()`` output for both objects
    * CPython: compares the memory address a object resides in
    * Is used for checking if ``None``
    * Testing strings with ``is`` only works when the strings are interned

Test if empty
-------------
.. code-block:: python

    if name is None:
        print('Your name is empty')
    else:
        print(f'Hello {name}')

Test if value is equal
----------------------
.. versionchanged:: Python 3.8
    Compiler produces a ``SyntaxWarning`` when identity checks (``is`` and ``is not``) are used with certain types of literals (e.g. ``str``, ``int``). These can often work by accident in *CPython*, but are not guaranteed by the language spec. The warning advises users to use equality tests (``==`` and ``!=``) instead.
