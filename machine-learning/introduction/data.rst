Nominal
=======
* No distance
* No quantities
* Cannot order

Can calculate
-------------
* Mode

Cannot calculate
----------------
* Mean

Example
-------
* Colors
* Weather
* Player numbers in football (cannot order, or cannot say that player 8 is better than 11)


Ordinal
=======
* Has order
* Has numerical value

Can calculate
-------------

Cannot calculate
----------------
* Distance between things

Example
-------
* Runners at the finish (they have oder, but position doesn't say about the distance)
* Humidity
* Rating system (5 stars movie is better than 4 stars, but there is no information how much better)


Interval
========
* Have order
* Have distance
* Has scale
* Has start
* Has end
* No absolute zero on the scale

Can Calculate
-------------
* mode
* median
* mean
* minimum
* maximum

Examples
--------
* Temperature C or F (zero is just a normal number, not a start or end of a scale)
* pH (pH zero is not a
* Dates


Ratio
=====
* Has order, distance

Can Calculate
-------------
* mode
